**Imaging Data Commons (IDC)** is a cloud-based resource of the [NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)][1] that connects researchers with:
* cancer image collections
* a robust infrastructure that contains imaging data, subject and sample metadata and experimental metadata from disparate sources
resources for searching, identifying and viewing images
* additional data types contained in other Cancer Research Data Commons nodes

Our work to establish IDC started in July 2019.

Pilot release of the platform took place on October 21, 2020. You can access the IDC portal at [https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov][3].

The slides below presented at RSNA 2019 provide an overall summary of the IDC development plans.
