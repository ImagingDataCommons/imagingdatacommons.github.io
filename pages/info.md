**Imaging Data Commons (IDC)** will be a cloud-based resource of the [NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)][1] that connects researchers with:
* cancer image collections
* a robust infrastructure that contains imaging data, subject and sample metadata and experimental metadata from disparate sources
resources for searching, identifying and viewing images
* additional data types contained in other Cancer Research Data Commons nodes

Our work to establish IDC started in July 2019. The development is following phased approach, and the project is currently in Phase II. The main deliverable for Phase II is the demonstration of functional IDC Minimum Viable Product (MVP) portal.

Our plans for IDC MVP are summarized in [this document][2]. Please share with us your comments or suggestions about IDC MVP!

The slides below provide an overall summary of the IDC development plans.
